Software Concept:

The concept behind this project is to build a revolutionary tool for learning musical instruments by combining cutting-edge technology for audio processing, note detection, and real-time visual feedback. We aim to allow users to play along with their favorite songs while receiving visual cues on how to perform the song's individual parts, making the experience engaging and intuitive. This project utilizes Spleeter for stem separation, librosa for note detection, and Pygame for real-time visual synchronization, all wrapped in an interface designed using Figma.

Technology Stack:

   Spleeter is a powerful open-source tool developed by Deezer that uses deep learning to separate audio tracks into stems (e.g., vocals, drums, bass, piano). By leveraging this technology, our app can take any user-uploaded song and break it down into its core instrumental components. This gives learners the ability to isolate specific instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, drums) to focus on playing them, while still listening to the rest of the song in the background.
   This feature enables a personalized learning experience where users can choose the instrument they want to practice, upload any track they love, and have the specific instrument highlighted while the rest of the song plays.

   Librosa is a widely used Python library for music and audio analysis, perfect for extracting the musical features we need, such as pitch, onset, and note detection. Once the user selects a specific stem (e.g., piano), librosa analyzes the audio to identify the notes and timing of each key press or strum.
   This real-time analysis allows us to map the audio data to visual cues that will later be triggered in the user interface. It ensures that every note played corresponds to an actionable visual highlight on the instrument, making learning not only fun but precise.

   Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for creating games and handling graphics. We utilize Pygame to create the real-time visual interaction where parts of the instrument (e.g., keys on a piano, frets on a guitar) light up as the corresponding notes are played in the song.
   The visual feedback is crucial for turning music learning into an immersive experience. As the user hears the rest of the song play, Pygame will be responsible for triggering the visual highlights that guide the user on what notes or chords to play in sync with the music.
   For example, in the case of a piano stem, Pygame will light up the piano keys on the user interface in perfect sync with the song’s melody, showing the user which notes to play at exactly the right time. This transforms the app into an interactive, hands-on learning tool, mimicking a tutor’s guidance.

   Figma is used to design a clean and intuitive graphic user interface. We’ve created custom instrument visuals (e.g., a piano keyboard, guitar fretboard) that will serve as the foundation of the user experience. The interface is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing users to focus on learning without any distractions.
   The user selects their song, chooses the instrument they want to play, and is then presented with an interactive, visual representation of that instrument. Every part of the interface is designed with clarity and usability in mind, ensuring a smooth and engaging learning experience.
 
   The user uploads their favorite song into the app. Using Spleeter, the song is automatically separated into individual stems (vocals, piano, drums, bass, etc.), allowing the user to focus on the instrument they want to practice.
 
   Once the user selects their preferred stem (e.g., piano), librosa analyzes the audio to detect the timing, pitch, and duration of the notes. This analysis is mapped into a visual sequence that corresponds to the instrument’s keys or parts.
 
   The app switches into learning mode, where the rest of the song plays audibly, and the chosen instrument is displayed visually on the screen. Pygame triggers the visual highlighting of keys (for piano), strings (for guitar), or other instrument parts in perfect sync with the song’s audio, guiding the user in real time on which notes to play.

   A unique feature of the app is its ability to support remote group practice. Multiple users can upload the same song, choose different instruments, and practice together in sync. Each user will see their respective instrument part highlighted on their screen, allowing them to practice as a band—virtually, from anywhere in the world.

Our project brings together the power of AI-driven music technology, real-time visual feedback, and custom user interfaces to create a next-level instrument-learning tool. It transforms the traditional way of learning music by allowing users to play along with their favorite songs, in sync with real-time feedback. The app also offers an innovative twist with remote band practice, opening up new ways for musicians to collaborate and learn together, even at a distance.

This project will not only appeal to musicians but also to anyone looking to learn an instrument with a fun, interactive, and highly effective tool. We’re bringing together audio and visual elements in a way that makes the process of learning music engaging, dynamic, and collaborative.
